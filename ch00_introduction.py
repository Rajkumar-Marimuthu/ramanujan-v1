# Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
# It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
# Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
# Python is used for web development (server side), software development, mathematics, system scripting
# created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
# Object oriented scripting language
# supports both functional and structured programming
# Dynamically and strongly typed
# Automatic garbage collection

# Python runs on an interpreter system. 
# to run python file, python <filename>
# to type program in commandline type python or py
# type exit() to quit command line

# Python can be treated in a procedural way, object oriented way, or a functional way
# Latest major version is Python 3

# Python uses new lines to complete a command instead of semicolon
# instead of curly brackets
print("Hello world")
print(100)

# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope for loops, functions and classes,
# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
